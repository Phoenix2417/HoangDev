Resource Monitor Readme File

THIS SETUP PROGRAM WILL INSTALL THE DATABASE WAREHOUSE AND
THE ADMINISTRATIVE CLIENT.

The DATABASE WAREHOUSE is where the monitoring clients report 
information.  This database must be located on a shared directory
on a server in which the monitoring clients must have access.

During the setup program, you will be asked to locate the path that
you desire to install the database.  If the database is already
installed, the setup program will validate its existence and continue
with the installation of the Administrative Client.

The ADMINISTRATIVE CLIENT allows you to view LIVE and HISTORICAL
monitored activity as well as managing clients and the database.
